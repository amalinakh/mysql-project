## 💻 System Requirements

Before running the app, make sure your computer meets these requirements:

- A modern web browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Safari).
- Internet connection (optional for backend features).
- Node.js installed (only if you want to run the backend server locally).
